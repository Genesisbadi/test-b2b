The treatment consists of acupressure massages of the chest, shoulders, upper arms, upper back, neck, scalp, ears and face. Lotion containing organic collagen, vitamin E, lactic acid, hydrating toner and calamine lotion is applied to nourish the face. Galvanic with ultrasonic gadget is used to aid in the absorption of the nourishment and to tone the facial skin. Toxins and impurities from the face and anterior neck are sucked out using a vacuum. Ice roller or cryo sticks are then used to close the pores. At the end of the treatment, one feels and looks refreshed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facial Detox<br /><br /></strong>Php 5,050 (30 minutes)<br /><br />An oriental technique of releasing toxins that cause aging, melasma breakouts, wrinkles, dryness, oiliness, acne, and psoriasis, this procedure consists of acupressure massage of the face, head, neck and shoulder with sweeping movements toward the lymphatic drainage using bian stone, jade gua sha, or animal horn. Essential oil is applied to the face and neck while doing the lymphatic drainage massage of the areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Body Rituals</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neck and Shoulder Rejuvenation<br /><br /></strong>Php 7,000 (45 minutes)<br /><br />The treatment relaxes the muscle by manipulation through acupressure, electronic facial gun or other gadget that releases tightness. A lymphatic drainage using gua sha technique is then applied. This treatment helps alleviate headache, dizziness, fatigue, vertigo, and insomnia.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tight Back and Shoulder Rejuvenation<br /><br /></strong>Php 7,000 (45 minutes)<br /><br />The treatment works by relaxing the muscles through manipulation and deep acupressure to unblock energy meridians. This method and the use of a fascial gun, releases the fascia that envelopes the right muscles. After which, heat followed by cold application softens the tight muscles. This treatment can improve blood circulation and eliminate toxins, improve flexibility, promote good sleep and enhance the immune system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Foot Care</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foot Detox with Foot Reflex<br /><br /></strong>Php 5,860 (60 minutes)<br /><br />This kind of detoxification releases toxins from the pores of the soles of the feet by soaking them in a basin of warm water with magnesium sulfate, and essential oils followed by a foot reflex.
