Heightened awareness. Increased distance. We&rsquo;ve become more selective about where we go. We&rsquo;ve secured our homes and workplaces. And while we&rsquo;ve learned to adjust, thanks in great part to online resources, there are some things still meant to be shared in person.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Discovery Hospitality Corporation (DHC), the management company behind award-winning brands Discovery Shores Boracay, Discovery Primea Makati, Club Paradise Palawan, and Discovery Suites Ortigas, launches <strong>Safe Space</strong>, a trailblazing initiative re-imagining meeting, event and celebration spaces and making them safe in the time of the global pandemic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the launch of Home Safe program ensuring best practices in safety, service and care among Discovery&rsquo;s hotels and resorts, to partnering with Lysol, Safe Space combines Discovery&rsquo;s signature brand of hospitality and strong commitment to guests&rsquo; safety.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Working from home has its perks, but for times when face-to-face meetups are called-for, safe space has to be expanded beyond usual limits. With DHC&rsquo;s shared <strong>Safe Space </strong>program, enjoy the comforts and safety of Discovery hotels.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Interview for an hour or the whole day.

Select desired service through the Safe Space booking platform: book preferred schedule, pay online, and relish in luxurious spaces sanitized on a per-use basis. Get personal appointment calendar for Discovery meetups. Re-imagine co-working space at Discovery. Meeting spaces are sanitized after each use following DHC&rsquo;s safety and sanitation protocols with Lysol products.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the government permits social gathering, <strong>Safe Space</strong> will likewise allow guests to enjoy <strong>essential moments</strong> in their safe space of choice (home, office or Discovery property) and focus more on what&rsquo;s at hand. Birthdays, weddings, staff meetings, corporate events, DHC&rsquo;s essential team will ensure a safe and responsible gathering based on guidelines set by no less than the Department of Tourism.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can&rsquo;t host in-house? DHC offers <strong>Space Rentals</strong>, taking care of the health and sanitation requirements, design, and other key elements with the client&rsquo;s or its in-house event planners. Intimate get-togethers crafted with the utmost attention to detail, none too small. Re-imagine the new normal, and discover familiar, longed-for moments and enjoy new experiences in safe spaces.
