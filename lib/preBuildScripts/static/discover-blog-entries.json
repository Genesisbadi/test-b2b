And with heartfelt delight, Mr. Jose Parre&ntilde;o, Jr., Chief Operating Officer of Discovery Hospitality Corporation, was presented with the esteemed title of &lsquo;COO of the Year in the Hospitality Sector of the Philippines.&rsquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Discovery Hospitality Corporation is a proud homegrown brand managing the Philippines&rsquo; best-loved hotels and resorts, namely Discovery Shores Boracay, Club Paradise Palawan, Discovery Suites, and Discovery Primea. Just this year, it opened two new properties: Manami Resort under its new brand called Signature Collection, and Discovery Samal, the first property to highlight the rebranded Discovery Resorts. From purely heading and operating these owned properties, DHC has trailblazed and expanded its horizons to more than just focusing on its own but also sharing its expertise from decades of experience to provide allied and shared services and property management with other businesses, all while continuing to lead its legacy onwards and upwards.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For Parre&ntilde;o, each award attributed to DHC serves as a reaffirmation of Discovery&rsquo;s goal of achieving excellence. &ldquo;We take pride in the continuous recognition from The World Business Outlook. These accolades not only inspire us but also serve as a reminder to consistently raise the standards in the hospitality field. Through continuous innovation, our aim is always to provide &ldquo;Service That&rsquo;s All Heart&rdquo; to each and every guest,&rdquo; added Parre&ntilde;o.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To DHC&rsquo;s management team, these awards reflect their collective passion and dedication, as well as the exceptional leadership of Parre&ntilde;o and Townes. Every recognition, according to Parre&ntilde;o, &ldquo;reflects the success of Discovery&rsquo;s efforts and the unforgettable experience we impart on our guests.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Over the years, the definition of luxury travel hasn&rsquo;t been merely a destination, but now the shift has moved into creating memorable and authentic experiences. By valuing each guest, we ensure they relish every moment of their stay with us, which in turn produces unparalleled service,&rdquo; Parre&ntilde;o concluded.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Discovery Hospitality Corporation continues to solidify its brand love and remarkable connections to its guest, business partners, and internal stakeholders. It strives to deliver authentic experiences that are true to the locale and build hotel brands that inspire the modern traveler, underpinned by genuine Filipino warmth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For inquiries on hotel management and digital shared services, contact DHC&rsquo;s Senior Vice President and Head of Sales and Operations, Cathy Nepomuceno, at <a href=\"mailto:cathy.nepomuceno@discoveryhospitality.com\">cathy.nepomuceno@discoveryhospitality.com</a>.
